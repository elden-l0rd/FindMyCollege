As high school students prepare to take the next step towards their future, deciding which university degree to pursue can be an overwhelming and stressful task. 
With so many options available, it can be difficult to know where to start. Choosing the right course may likely determine your entire careerâ€™s trajectory, so it is crucial that students choose a degree that they will enjoy and feel a passion towards.

This is where a website that recommends courses based on students' subject interests, personality, and scores can be a valuable tool. By curating a set of recommended 
courses, the website can help students make informed decisions that can have a significant impact on their future career. In this digital age, the website serves as a 
beacon of guidance, helping students to navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of higher education.

The purpose of FindMyCollege is to empower students to make informed academic decisions by providing a personalized and user-friendly tool to identify suitable university 
courses based on their interests, strengths, personality and career aspirations.
